## issues

* [ ] ANY chat message resets the idle timer
* [ ] `!camera` for changing camera
* [x] `!punch` cannot chop a tree, it is not held long enough
* [ ] crafting
* [ ] scooter can get stuck on a vehicle and there's no way to get off
* [ ] `!help <command>` doesn't give any response
* [x] `!walk forward <number>` number doesn't have any effect
* [ ] twitch chat doesn't let chatters post similar messages
* [x] It's almost impossible to zero in on a Node we want to interact with (turn/look granularity too high)
* [x] idle timeout is too low
* [x] idle commands are interruptive -- bot teleports character back to spawn when chatter is trying to go somewhere
* [x] `!server` command is missing
* [x] Server info not displayed on rotation
* [ ] `!look right` should `!turn right`
* [ ] `/anchors`
* [ ] invisible exploit-- get on scooter, warp to spawn, warp home, get killed while on scooter.
